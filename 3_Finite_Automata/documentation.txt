Explanation of Components:

States

- Definition: A list of all states in the automaton.
- Format: A comma-separated list of state names following the keyword States:
- Example from FA.in:
    States: q0,q1,q2,q3
- Explanation: The automaton has four states: q0, q1, q2, and q3.
    Each state is uniquely identified.

Alphabet

- Definition: A list of all symbols in the automaton's alphabet.
- Format: A comma-separated list of symbols following the keyword Alphabet:.
- Example from FA.in:
    Alphabet: a,b
- Explanation: The automaton processes two input symbols: a and b.

Transitions

- Definition: A list of rules defining the transitions between states based on input symbols.
- Format: One transition per line after the keyword Transitions:. Each transition is in the form state,symbol->state.
- Example from FA.in:
    Transitions:
    q0,a->q1
    q1,b->q2
    q2,a->q3
    q3,b->q0
- Explanation:
    When in state q0 and the input is a, the automaton transitions to state q1.
    When in state q1 and the input is b, the automaton transitions to state q2.
    When in state q2 and the input is a, the automaton transitions to state q3.
    When in state q3 and the input is b, the automaton transitions back to state q0.

Final States

- Definition: A list of all final or accepting states in the automaton.
- Format: A comma-separated list of state names following the keyword FinalStates:.
- Example from FA.in:
    FinalStates: q3
- Explanation: State q3 is the only accepting state.
    The automaton accepts an input if it ends in this state after processing the input string.
